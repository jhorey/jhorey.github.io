<a name="about-me" class="anchor" href="#about-me"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Me</h3>

<p>I'm interested in "big data" systems, parallel programming models, and privacy/security algorithms. My approach to work is primarily systems and software-oriented: I identify real-world problems, design and implement a novel solution in software, and experimentally validate the software. I also happen to work at Oak Ridge National Lab as a research scientist.  </p>

<a name="projects" class="anchor" href="#projects"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Projects</h3>

<p>I have both "official" and "for fun" projects. </p>

<ul>
<li>I (and many of my colleagues at ORNL) have been helping the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) modernize their analytic capabilities. Here are some links from the press:

<p>I also happen to publish papers once a while. I am in the process of releasing some of these results in a more suitable format (i.e., GitHub). In the meantime here is a simple list in chronological order. </p>
