{"name":"James Horey","tagline":"Big Data Engineer","body":"### About Me\r\nI'm interested in \"big data\" systems, parallel programming models, and privacy/security algorithms. My approach to work is primarily systems and software-oriented: I identify real-world problems, design and implement a novel solution in software, and experimentally validate the software. I also happen to work at Oak Ridge National Lab as a research scientist.  \r\n\r\n### Projects\r\nI have both \"official\" and \"for fun\" projects. \r\n\r\n* I (and many of my colleagues at ORNL) have been helping the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) modernize their analytic capabilities. Here are some links from the press:\r\nhttp://gcn.com/articles/2012/03/09/cms-analytics-project-health-care-big-data.aspx\r\nhttp://technews.tmcnet.com/knowledge-management/topics/knowledge-management/articles/303131-cms-unveils-knowledge-discovery-infrastructure-aims-patient-data.htm\r\n* [Spot Hadoop](https://github.com/jhorey/SpotHadoop): Spot-Hadoop is a tool to dynamically configure, launch, and benchmark Hadoop on shared, parallel filesystems (namely Lustre).\r\n* [Paja](https://github.com/jhorey/Paja): Paja is an implementation of Paxos for Java.\r\n* [KevaDB](https://github.com/jhorey/KevaDB): KevaDB is a key-value storage library for Java with support for multiple branches and historical values.\r\n\r\n### Publications\r\nI also happen to publish papers once a while. I am in the process of releasing some of these results in a more suitable format (i.e., GitHub). In the meantime here is a simple list in chronological order. \r\n\r\n* \"Performance Implications from Sizing a VM on Multi-core Systems: A Data Analytic Application's View\", Seung-Hwan Lim, James Horey, Yanjun Yao, Edmon Begoli, and Qing Cao.
